Boston Celtics (+325)
Look, it's not fun. It's not really a great value at just over 3-to-1 odds. It's not a head-turning prediction or a hot take. But picking the reigning champs as the best bet to win the 2025 Finals is the only call to make.
The Celtics were dominant last season, and the only thing that slowed down their record pace was rest when Joe Mazzulla realized the sheer distance between Boston and the rest of the pack in the second half of the regular season. Boston won the East by 14 games despite a late-season carousel of rest days for his stars.        
This season, the league will be less injured and the competition — at least, in theory — will be better, especially in the East. The Knicks powered up. The Sixers powered up. The Cavs got healthy. This is all good for the Celtics, who are running it back completely after going 16-3 en route to championship banner No. 18.
